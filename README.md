There is a sql file among the source files. This file is for the installation of database. It's worth mentionning that we used PostgreSQL 12.
1-Think to alter the connection-attributes( username and password of your database) to database in properties-files.

2-Think also to update your project(with Maven) in order to download dependencies such as Lombock, ModelMapper,etc..
